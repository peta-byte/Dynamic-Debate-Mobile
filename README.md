# Dynamic Debate Mobile
The mobile (React Native) version of my Dynamic Debate web app (Angular).



To use these files:

1. Start with a bare React Native (JS) app: `npx react-native init DynamicDebate`
2. Replace the files in the new project with the ones in this repo
3. Install the app's dependencies: Run `npm i`
4. Open an emulator/simulator or have your device ready
5. Run the app: `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
